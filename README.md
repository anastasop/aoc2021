# Advent of Code 2021

This repo contains my solutions for the [2021 edition of the Advent of Code programming puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2021). The code and the input files for each day are in the corresponding directories. This year i program in go. Each solution is a single file go program which you can try with `go run A.go < input.txt`.
